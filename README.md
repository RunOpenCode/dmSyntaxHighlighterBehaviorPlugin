dmSyntaxHighlighterBehaviorPlugin for Diem Extended is adaptation of
[SyntaxHighlighter](http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/) packed to be
used as behavior for Diem.

It will add a nice syntax highlight of your code on page where you have a `<PRE>`
tag. You can attach behavior on Widget or Zone.

It uses a `<PRE />` method as described in [documentation]
(http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/manual/installation.html).
